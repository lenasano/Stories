The chickadees are a group of North American birds in the tit family included in the genus Poecile. Species found in North America are referred to as chickadees, while other species in the genus are called tits[citation needed]. They are small-sized birds overall, usually having the crown of the head and throat patch distinctly darker than the body. They are at least 6 to 14 centimeters (2.4 to 5.5 inches) in size.

Their name reputedly comes from the fact that their calls make a distinctive "chick-a-dee-dee-dee",[1] though their normal call is actually fee-bee, and the famous[citation needed] chick-a-dee-dee-dee is an alarm call. The number of "dees" depends on the predator.[2]

The chickadee (specifically the black-capped chickadee Poecile atricapillus, formerly Parus atricapillus) is the official[citation needed] bird for the US states of Massachusetts and Maine,[3][4][5] the Canadian province of New Brunswick,[6] and the city of Calgary, Alberta.[7]

One holarctic species is referred to by a different name in each part of its range: grey-headed chickadee in North America and Siberian tit in Eurasia.
